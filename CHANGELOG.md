# Changelog - Football Results Guesser

## Latest Updates - Badge System Overhaul

### Clear Console Logging & Debugging
✅ **Structured Console Logs**
- All badge operations now use clear prefixes: `[CACHE]`, `[SUCCESS]`, `[FAILED]`, `[ERROR]`, `[TRACKED]`
- Step-by-step logging shows exactly what's happening during badge fetch
- Easy to identify issues at a glance

✅ **Debug Commands**
- `showMissingTeams()` - View teams using placeholder badges in console
- `exportMissingTeams()` - Download `MissingTeams.txt` file with full report
- Automatically available when game loads

✅ **Missing Teams Tracking**
- System tracks all teams that needed placeholder badges
- Export feature creates downloadable report for analysis
- Helps identify which teams need manual mappings

### Multi-Source Badge System
✅ **3-Tier Fallback Architecture**
1. **TheSportsDB** (Primary) - High quality official badges
2. **Wikipedia** (Fallback) - Good coverage for less popular teams
3. **Generated Placeholder** (Last Resort) - SVG badges with team initials

✅ **Benefits**
- No game bias toward popular teams
- All teams from OpenFootball data can be used
- 100% badge coverage guaranteed
- Graceful degradation from best to acceptable quality

### Comprehensive Documentation
✅ **New Documentation Files**
- `DEBUG_GUIDE.md` - Complete debugging reference with examples
- `BADGE_FIXES.md` - Badge loading solutions and CORS guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file, tracking all improvements

✅ **Updated README**
- Clear CORS warning and local server instructions
- Debug commands section
- Multi-source badge system explanation
- Updated project structure

### Code Quality Improvements
✅ **Clear Comments**
- Every function has detailed comments explaining purpose
- Error handling sections clearly marked with `===== ERROR: Type =====`
- Success paths marked with `===== SUCCESS =====`
- Examples provided in comments

✅ **Better Error Handling**
- Rate limit detection and automatic retry
- Network error catching and reporting
- HTTP status code checking
- Graceful fallbacks at every level

### Bug Fixes
✅ **CORS Error Documentation**
- Clear explanation of why file:// doesn't work
- Multiple local server options provided

## How to Use New Features

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Start game with local server**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open browser console (F12)**

3. **Play the game** - Watch console logs in real-time

4. **Check for issues**
   - Look for `[ERROR]` messages
   - Note any `[FAILED]` patterns

5. **After game, run debug commands**
   ```javascript
   showMissingTeams()    // View in console
   exportMissingTeams()  // Download report
   ```

6. **Review MissingTeams.txt**
   - See which teams needed placeholders
   - Add manual mappings if needed

### Console Log Example

```
[START] Fetching badge for "Auxerre"...
[TIER 1] Trying TheSportsDB...
  → Will try 4 search variations: Auxerre, Auxerre, AJ, Auxerre
  → Attempt 1/4: Searching for "Auxerre"
  [SUCCESS] Found soccer team: Auxerre
[SUCCESS] Badge found via TheSportsDB for "Auxerre"
```

### Export Example

Run `exportMissingTeams()` in console to get:

```
# Missing Team Badges Report
# Generated: 2025-01-15T10:30:45.123Z
# Teams that needed placeholder badges
# Total: 2 teams

1. Le Havre AC
2. Angers SCO

---
Note: These teams are using generated placeholder badges.
Consider adding manual mappings for these teams in TEAM_NAME_MAPPING.
```

## Technical Details

### Badge Caching
- All badges cached in `teamBadgeCache` object
- Prevents duplicate API calls
- Persists for browser session
- Cache hits logged with `[CACHE]` prefix

### Search Term Generation
For each team, system tries:
1. Mapped name (from `TEAM_NAME_MAPPING`)
2. Original cleaned name
3. First word only
4. Last word only
5. Name without common prefixes (FC, AC, AS, etc.)

### Placeholder Generation
- Extracts initials (max 3 letters)
- Generates consistent color via hash
- Creates SVG data URI
- Example: "Paris Saint-Germain" → "PSG" badge with unique color

### Error Recovery
- Rate limit: Wait 1s, retry
- Network error: Try next search term
- API down: Move to next tier
- All failed: Generate placeholder

- [ ] Pre-download common team badges
- [ ] Add team-specific fallback URLs
